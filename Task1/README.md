IEEE ZSB Rookies training


1- Write a program that calculates the area and the perimeter of a rectangle. The 
program asks the user for two numbers, each number on a separate line. One of 
the numbers represents the length and the other represents the width. 

EX: 
Input: 
5 
6 

Output: 
30 
22 



2- Write a program that asks the user to input a number, n > 1 and prints all 
prime numbers from 1 to n inclusive. The output numbers should be on one line
with a space separating between them. 

EX: 
Input: 
15 

Output: 
2 3 5 7 11 13 


3- Implement binary search 

4- Write a program that takes a sentence and prints it, word per line, in a 
rectangular frame.

5- Write a program that contains three functions that compute the sum of the 
numbers in a list. The first function uses for loop, the second function uses while 
loop and the third function uses recursion. 
Input: 
2 lines, the first contains integer, n, representing the size of the list (how many 
numbers in the list) 
The second consists of n space-separated integers, representing the numbers in 
the list 
Output: 
The output should be on three lines: the first line is the output of the first function, 
the second is for the second function and the third is for the third function. 

EX: 
Input: 
3 
5 8 4 

Output: 
17 
17 
17


6- Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the 
numbers 1 to n inclusive.n will always be greater than 1. 
EX: 
Input: 
5 

Output: 
15
 

7- Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are 
considered in the sum. 
EX:
 
Input: 
15 

Output: 
60 
Explanation: 
Only numbers (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15) as (3, 6, 9, 12) are multiples of 3 and (5, 10, 
15) are multiples of 5. So the answer will be 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 = 60
 


8- Write a guessing game. The program will generate a random number between 
1 and 10 and ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. If they don't 
make the correct guess the program will ask them to enter another number and 
so on. Until they get it right, the program will print the number of the tries they 
needed to answer correctly

9- Write a program that takes input a number, n > 0 and generates the first n 
fibonacci numbers. 
EX:
 
Input: 
8 

Output: 
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
